# rules
*Rule files of some use to us, and perhaps some scripts*

In particular @thatguy31415 is working on a collection of rules to categorize files by capabilities, with inspiration from
michael.ligh@mnin.org's marvelous example in Chapter 4 of the *Malware Analyst Cookbook*, carried from Google Code into GitHub by @yararules, and shipped in @lennyzeltser's @REMnux (seriously, the MD5 hashes match).

## here
* some simple yara rules that hit on imported libraries and function calls (CAP_something)
* a batch processing Volatility script or two (eg for SIFT)
* other sample yara rules, such as for PE module
* a sed script for cleaning up VBA code syntax
* OpenIOC examples, such as for Trickbot patterns reported by @hasherazade

## todos
* [.] Win32 Inet CAP yara rule : string match works
	* [ ] needs ordinal detection, which will require yara++ and pe module
* [.] Win32 crypto CAP yara rule : string match works
	* [ ] needs ordinal detection, which will require yara++ and pe module
* [ ] Ransomware strings CAP yara rule 
	* cryptocurrency help sites?
* [ ] DotNet CAP yara rule
	* DotNet doesn't use PE header so much 	
* [.] OpenIOC sample rules, but see some [caveats](https://gist.github.com/adricnet/cb46d182200a40deb6d62c3906da59c9)

```
### Volatility semi-automated memory image processing, for WinXP images
### bsk for dfirnotes.org, Copyleft MIT License : https://github.com/DFIRnotes/rules/blob/master/LICENSE
### Requirements: SIFT 3 or volatility 2.5.x ; pictures needs PIL and dot available
### Run volatility framework anlaysis plugins against a provided image in an opinionated order
###     0) Quick pass to list processes and connections, 1)long run of many plugins with simple args, 
###     2) long run of complex plugins; 3)make pictures

TODOs
---

```
### TODO  
## BUGFIX: Set out location to . if env var not set
## FEATURE: document how to branch -2
## FEATURE: Pull volatility version rather than static string
## FEATURE: if file exists and is greater than sizeof(vol usage error), skip the plugin ?
## FEATURE: tidy malsysproc extra linefeeds ?
## WISHLIST: find a way to use the ssdeep, baseline community plugins 
## WISHLIST perf : Specify kdbg offset?
## WISHLIST: duplicate image file to run plugins in parallel for faster results / test this more
## WISHLIST: port to BAT for Windows or BETTER python for crossplatform
###
